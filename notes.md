Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of tasks for the **Web-Based MVP using WASM + IndexedDB**:

---

### **Epic 1: Owner Resource Management**

#### **Task 1.1: Create a New Resource**  
**As an** owner  
**I need** to create a new resource  
**So that** I can manage and offer it to clients  

### **Details and Assumptions**  
* A resource has basic attributes: `name`, `description`, `price`, and `availability`.  
* Data is stored in IndexedDB using a predefined schema.  
* Form validation ensures all fields are completed before submission.  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given an owner is logged into the system  
When they fill in the resource creation form with valid details  
Then the resource is saved in IndexedDB and displayed in the resource list  

Given an owner leaves any required field empty  
When they attempt to save the resource  
Then the system displays an error message and prevents saving  
```

---

#### **Task 1.2: View Resources**  
**As an** owner  
**I need** to see a list of all my resources  
**So that** I can manage them effectively  

### **Details and Assumptions**  
* The resources are retrieved from IndexedDB.  
* Resources are displayed in a table or card view, with basic details visible.  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given there are resources stored in IndexedDB  
When the owner navigates to the resource management page  
Then the system displays a list of resources with their details  

Given no resources are stored in IndexedDB  
When the owner navigates to the resource management page  
Then the system displays a "No resources available" message  
```

---

#### **Task 1.3: Edit a Resource**  
**As an** owner  
**I need** to edit an existing resource  
**So that** I can update its details  

### **Details and Assumptions**  
* Changes are persisted in IndexedDB.  
* The resource list updates automatically after editing.  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given a resource exists in the system  
When the owner modifies its details in the edit form  
Then the updated resource is saved in IndexedDB and displayed in the list  

Given invalid changes (e.g., empty required fields)  
When the owner attempts to save the resource  
Then the system displays an error message and prevents saving  
```

---

#### **Task 1.4: Delete a Resource**  
**As an** owner  
**I need** to delete a resource  
**So that** I can remove outdated or irrelevant entries  

### **Details and Assumptions**  
* A confirmation prompt is displayed before deletion.  
* The resource is removed from IndexedDB.  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given a resource exists in the system  
When the owner clicks the delete button and confirms the action  
Then the resource is removed from IndexedDB and no longer displayed  

Given a resource exists in the system  
When the owner cancels the delete confirmation  
Then the resource remains unchanged in IndexedDB  
```

### **Epic 2: IndexedDB Integration**

#### **Task 2.1: Set Up IndexedDB Schema**  
**As a** developer  
**I need** to define the schema for IndexedDB  
**So that** resources can be stored and retrieved efficiently  

### **Details and Assumptions**  
* IndexedDB will store resources as objects with attributes: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, and `availability`.  
* Use a wrapper library like `idb` for simpler integration.  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given a defined schema  
When the application initializes  
Then IndexedDB is created with the specified schema  
```

---

#### **Task 2.2: CRUD Operations for Resources**  
**As a** developer  
**I need** to implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations  
**So that** the application can manage resource data  

### **Details and Assumptions**  
* Operations will use IndexedDB's asynchronous API or a wrapper library.  
* Each operation will handle exceptions (e.g., schema mismatch).  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given a valid resource  
When it is added to IndexedDB  
Then it is stored and retrievable in subsequent requests  

Given an existing resource in IndexedDB  
When it is updated or deleted  
Then the changes are reflected in IndexedDB and the UI  
```

---

### **Epic 3: UI Development**

#### **Task 3.1: Resource Management UI**  
**As an** owner  
**I need** a user-friendly interface for managing resources  
**So that** I can easily create, view, edit, and delete resources  

### **Details and Assumptions**  
* Forms for creating and editing resources.  
* Tables or cards for displaying resources.  
* Buttons for edit and delete actions.  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given the resource management page  
When the owner performs actions like create, view, edit, or delete  
Then the UI reflects the changes immediately  
```

---

### **Epic 4: WASM Integration**

#### **Task 4.1: Compile Business Logic to WASM**  
**As a** developer  
**I need** to compile core business logic to WebAssembly  
**So that** it can run efficiently in the browser  

### **Details and Assumptions**  
* Use AssemblyScript, Rust, or Blazor for compiling to WASM.  
* Business logic includes validation rules and data manipulation.  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given the WASM module is loaded in the browser  
When the business logic is invoked  
Then it processes data correctly and returns expected results  
```

---

### **Epic 5: Testing and Validation**

#### **Task 5.1: Unit Tests for WASM Functions**  
**As a** developer  
**I need** to validate WASM functions with unit tests  
**So that** I can ensure the correctness of the business logic  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given the WASM functions  
When tested with valid and invalid inputs  
Then they produce the expected outputs in all cases  
```

#### **Task 5.2: End-to-End Testing for Resource Management**  
**As a** developer  
**I need** to simulate user interactions for resource management  
**So that** I can ensure the entire flow works as expected  

### **Acceptance Criteria**  

```gherkin
Given the resource management UI  
When an owner performs actions (create, edit, delete)  
Then the IndexedDB and UI reflect the correct state  
```

Would you like to focus on implementing any specific task, or should I assist with coding one of these features?
